=== Prerequisites

* You have access to OpenShift Container Platform cluster. Developers can use link:https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_codeready_containers/1.0/html/getting_started_guide/index[CodeReady Containers (CRC)] to deploy a local OpenShift Container Platform cluster quickly.
* You have installed link:https://openshift.github.io/pipelines-docs/docs/0.8/assembly_installing-pipelines.html[OpenShift Pipelines] using the OpenShift Pipeline Operator listed in the OpenShift OperatorHub. Once installed, it is applicable to the entire cluster.
* You have installed the https://openshift.github.io/pipelines-docs/docs/0.8/proc_installing-cli.html[Tekton CLI].

=== Procedure

. Login to your OpenShift Container Platform cluster with your login and password:
+
----
$ oc login -u <login> -p <password> https://openshift.example.com:6443
----

. Create a project for the sample application:
+
----
$ oc new-project pipelines-tutorial
----

. Run the following command to see the `pipeline` service account:
+
----
$ oc get serviceaccount pipeline
----

. In the OpenShift Web Console switch to the *Developer* perspective of the OpenShift Web Console.

. Select the *pipelines-tutorial* project from the *Project* drop-down menu. On the *Topology* view of the *Developer* perspective, you will be able to see the resources of your Pipeline. The deployment at this stage is not complete. The `Pipeline` you create in the next steps builds the simple application which has a front-end and a back-end and completes the deployment.
